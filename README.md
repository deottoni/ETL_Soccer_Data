# ETL Project Proposal

We have decided to extract two soccer datasets, one with individual [data on the players](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19), and the other has [data on the 2018 FIFA World cup squads](https://www.kaggle.com/cclayford/2018-fifa-world-cup-squads).

Our project will consist in cleaning the two datasets, do some analysis (i.e. average salary per WC squad), and load tables into our database.

We'll use MySQL as our production DB.
